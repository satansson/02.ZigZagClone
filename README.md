This is my 2nd game in a 'Complete C# Unity Developer: Create Games and Learn to Code' course on Udemy. It was done in october 2020.
In here, I've learned how to create a simple 3D Game with procedural map building and how to work with different Assets taken from the Unity official store or from the other sources. I've also learned basic lighting principles.
