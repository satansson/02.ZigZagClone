This is my 2nd game in a 'Complete C# Unity Developer: Create Games and Learn to Code' course on Udemy. It was done in october 2020.
In here, I've learned how to:
- create a simple 3D Game with procedural map building;
- work with different Assets taken from the Unity official store or from the other sources;
- work with basic lighting principles;
- work with particle effects system;
- build the game for PC (any OS).
